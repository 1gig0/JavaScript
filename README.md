# JavaScript

### JavaScript Principles

- When the javascript code runs, it:
  - Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/‘executes’  each line - known as the thread of execution
  - Saves ‘data’ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory
  
We can even save code (‘functions’)


**Functions**

Code we save (‘define’) functions & can use (call/invoke/execute/run) later with the function’s name & ()

**Functions in javascript = first class object**

The can co-exit with and can be treated like any other javascript object
 
 1. Assigned to variables and properties of other objects
 2. Passed as argument into functions
 3. Returned as value from functions
